# Project Vision for a Secure, Performance, Multi-Platform Operating System

The objective of this project is to create a robust operating system that balances high-level security with efficient performance by utilizing containerization technology, specifically through Firecracker. Each application will run in its own isolated container, ensuring enhanced security by preventing direct access between applications. This containerized approach will provide a more efficient alternative to traditional virtualization, reducing system overhead while maintaining strong isolation.
The operating system will support the x86_64 architecture, ensuring broad compatibility with modern processors from various manufacturers. Key components will include a variety of virtualization and emulation technologies to provide comprehensive platform support. Waydroid will be integrated into the system to run Android APK installations that are compatible with the x86_64 architecture in a container on the Linux kernel, offering a balanced approach to security, privacy, and performance for these x86_64-compatible Android applications. Wine will serve as the default tool for running Windows applications; however, for those incompatible with Wine, KVM + VFIO will be used to virtualize them. KVM + VFIO will also be employed to virtualize both Android (especially for applications running on ARM architecture) and Windows systems. This layered approach will provide flexible and reliable support for a wide range of Android and Windows applications.
Security will be the primary focus of the system. The core environment will be fully isolated from the internet to mitigate potential threats, while other system components and containers will have independent internet access as needed. This isolation will safeguard the core environment while still allowing applications to function normally with online connectivity.
In addition to the primary focus on security, the system will ensure that privacy is protected. The structure of the operating system will limit the ability of applications to access other applications or system files, preserving user privacy and maintaining system integrity.
To keep the core environment secure, an offline update mechanism will be employed. This will allow updates to the core system and its tools to be installed without requiring direct internet access, ensuring that the integrity of the isolated environment is never compromised.
Another key feature of the system is its flexibility. Built on Arch Linux, the system will leverage the Arch User Repository (AUR), allowing users to access a wide range of Linux packages. This will significantly enhance the overall user experience, providing a rich ecosystem of software for various use cases.
The goal of this project is to create a secure, high-performance operating system that supports multiple platforms while ensuring that the core environment remains isolated, secure, and private at all times.
